  "text": "Mr. Brown accomplished more in 24 hours than I had in five months pro per. I had struggled with my case (a request for Relief of Firearms Prohibition) for nearly half of a year and four fruitless hearings before I came to Mr. Brown. I had only wanted a consultation with him to get information on the laws regarding my case, but I decided to hire him once he demonstrated how knowledgeable he was (and is). Two days later, he won my case. As far as price goes, I believe his rates are very fair, considering the quality of his services. I even got a good part of my retainer back. Mr. Brown is very professional, and very down-to-business. I recommend him highly. My only regret is that I did not hire him earlier."
