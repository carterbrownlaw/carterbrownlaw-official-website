  "text": "I hired Mr. Brown to represent me in defending against my ex-fiance’s application for a domestic violence restraining order. The case went to trial and in the second day of trial, after Mr. Brown began presenting my case, my ex-fiancé and her attorney stated that they would agree to dismiss her application for restraining order. Because of Mr. Brown’s preparation for trial and trial strategy, my ex-fiancé and her attorney came to realize her application would not be granted and they dismissed the application before the judge could even make a ruling. I recommend Mr. Brown’s services to anyone seeking an aggressive litigator who will present the strongest case possible to achieve favorable results for their client."
