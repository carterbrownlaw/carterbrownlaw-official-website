TODO:
Production webpack config file.
It needs to have the mini-css-extract-plugin.
Add it and notice how your page load time shrinks.
Same needs to happen with js files. Use uglifyjsplugin.

Things to not forget:
        You have a heavy font loaded that is not being used.
        Jquery is laoded but you are not using it.
