When you need an energetic and engaged lawyer who will cross every t. and dot every i. and who will insist that the opposing side stay on the, \\"up and up\\" Steven Brown is the Attorney to contact."},{"author":"Suzanne","text":"My husband and I needed a lawyer for a very scary time in our lives and someone recommended Angela Carter and we are so grateful they did.  What she\'s done for us is truly amazing.  Angela Carter went above and beyond.  She made us not feel scared of what was happening!  Angela Carter got us through one of the toughest times of our lives and we\'re very grateful for her!  We definitely recommend Angela Carter... she goes above and beyond!"},{"author":"Greg","text":"Angela has the two qualities most necessary in a lawyer: knowledge and compassion. Her in-depth understanding of the law, when paired with her kindness, makes her a stellar advocate and a wonderful person to have on your side."},{"author":"Carol","text":"Angela Carter is very professional, holds herself to high standards and doesn’t back down. She will not sugar coat things and is honest and to the point.  Angela will treat you like family and she handled my case as if it was the only one she had, working long hours and fixing everything for me."},{"author":"client","text":"I hired Mr. Brown to represent me regarding various drug possession offenses. Mr. Brown was able to convince the District Attorney to dismiss my case because I was illegally stopped by the investigating officer. Mr. Brown is a very competent attorney that pays attention to detail. I recommend him for anyone facing criminal charges."},{"author":"client","text":"I hired Mr. Brown to represent me in defending against my ex-fiance’s application for a domestic violence restraining order. The case went to trial and in the second day of trial, after Mr. Brown began presenting my case, my ex-fiancé and her attorney stated that they would agree to dismiss her application for restraining order. Because of Mr. Brown’s preparation for trial and trial strategy, my ex-fiancé and her attorney came to realize her application would not be granted and they dismissed the application before the judge could even make a ruling. I recommend Mr. Brown’s services to anyone seeking an aggressive litigator who will present the strongest case possible to achieve favorable results for their client."},{"author":"client","text":"I was involved in an embarrassing situation regarding my conduct. Steven helped my situation proceed in a quick manor and got my case thrown out of court. I appreciated his hard work."},{"author":"client","text":"Mr. Brown accomplished more in 24 hours than I had in five months pro per. I had struggled with my case (a request for Relief of Firearms Prohibition) for nearly half of a year and four fruitless hearings before I came to Mr. Brown. I had only wanted a consultation with him to get information on the laws regarding my case, but I decided to hire him once he demonstrated how knowledgeable he was (and is). Two days later, he won my case. As far as price goes, I believe his rates are very fair, considering the quality of his services. I even got a good part of my retainer back. Mr. Brown is very professional, and very down-to-business. I recommend him highly. My only regret is that I did not hire him earlier."},{"author":"Dane","text":"Mr. Brown went above and beyond for me and my case.
